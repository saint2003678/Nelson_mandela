        <p>Nelson Mandela (1918 – 2013) was a South African political activist who spent over 20 years in prison for his
            opposition to the apartheid regime; he was released in 1990. In 1994, Mandela was later elected the first
            leader of a democratic South Africa.
            He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (jointly with F.W. de Klerk) in 1993 for his work in helping to end
            racial segregation in South Africa.

        <p>He is considered the father of a democratic South Africa and widely admired for his ability to bring together
            a nation, previously divided by apartheid. Nelson Mandela is one of the most admired political leaders of
            the Twentieth and Twenty-First Century for his vision to forgive and forge a new 'rainbow' nation.
            In 1963, Mandela was again arrested and put on trial for treason. This time the State succeeded in
            convicting Mandela of plotting to overthrow the government. However, the case received considerable
            international attention and the apartheid regime of South Africa became under the glare of the international
            community. At the end of his trial, Nelson Mandela made a long speech, in which he was able to affirm his
            commitment to the ideals of democracy.
